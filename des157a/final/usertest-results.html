                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    This user test was quite beneficial to me. It's all too easy to get caught up in one's own design while producing something that will eventually end up in the hands of a consumer. It was eye-opening to see how other people connected with and used my site. <br> The basic gist of the questions that I asked are as follows:
                    <li> First impressions? How does the typeface and the colors used look to you? Would you change them?</li>
                    <li> Is there anything that you wish that the enlarged image view had?</li>
                    <li> Do you think the website conveys the majestic beauty of Egypt?</li>
                </p>
                <h3>Observation - Alvin</h3>
                <p>
                    Alvin was able to identify almost all of the interactions instantly during the first 2 minutes. He really liked the font used and also loved the fact that hovering over the font improved the legibility which according to him is great UX design. Regarding the enlarged image view, he thought that it was fine as it is and there was no need to make any new changes. Lastly,  he did think that the website conveyed the "majesty of Egypt" and sold a great depiction of what Egypt in essence really is. However, he did wish that there was an indication somewhere regarding horizontal scroll using "shift + mouse wheel" which could improve the user experience by a good amount.

                <h3>Observation - Yutaka</h3>
                <p>
                    Yutaka took some time exploring with the hover animations of the pictures which eventually did lead to a great observation. He found out that some of the top photos were going behind the header and were obstructed by the header during hover. He loved the font and the legibility of the font used when hovering. He also mentioned that the borders that pop up during hovering over the text was a "nice touch". For the last question, he wanted the images to be a bit larger in the enlarged view.

                <h3>Observation - Raymond</h3>
                <p>
                    Raymond generally had the same opinion regarding my website however he didn't like the borders that popped out when hovering over text which contrasts with what Yutaka said. He also suggested adding a different design for the header (and not just a bland color) which is actually an amazing suggestion according to me! He also pointed out something that none of my other classmates did, and it is the fact that this website conveys the feeling of a tourist website and with some minor modifications it could definitely be able to sell Egypt as a destination to potential tourists!

                <h3>Project goals based on feedback received</h3>
                <p>
                    With the feedback that I have received, I will be adding a couple of additional touches to my website, and they are as follows:<br>
                    <li> I'll be adding some type of design for the header (maybe some kind of filter) that meshes well with the other parts of my website.</li>
                    <li> I'll try to employ what Yutaka suggested and enlarge the images as much as possible.</li>
                    <li> I'll fix the problem with the photos going behind the header during hover.</li>
                    <li> I'll be adding another button that will pop up an overlay with instructions regarding how to use the website.</li>
                    Some stuff that I'll be adding outside suggestions: <br>
                    I really liked Rachel's idea of a loading bar and a main page with a boarding pass since the idea would also work perfectly on my website, therefore I'll be adding something in that vein in my website too.
