                <h3>Project Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    For the final project, I am considering to significantly expand on my every picture
                    studio with the use of more interactions and expanded visuals.
                </p>
                <h3>Comparison 1</h3>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/stories/microsoft-datacenter-tour/" target="_blank">This datacenter tour site from Microsoft</a>
                    also encapsulates a portion of what I aim to achieve. This interactive experience allows 
                    the visitor to walk through and examine their data center, which is essentially what I want the users of
                    my website to feel like. I want the selections, animations and the information displayed by each picture to be
                    very interactive. Ofcourse, implementing the 3D aspect of this is simply not feasible within this timeframe, but it
                    could definitely have been achieved with three.js and 3D models from Blender/Maya. Below is a picture of the website in question.

                <h3>Comparison 2</h3>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.54ka.org/apps/scattered-photo-gallery/examples/009/" target="_blank">This wesbite that I found from browsing GitHub</a>
                    encompasses exactly what I want to do with the images. When the user clicks each images, I want them to play certain animations, and stack in
                    such a way that "feels" extremely interactive and unique to the user. This however, may not be possible to completely implement
                    but I will still try to make this work. But I do plan to add small touches that should make my website feel more interactive  like image 
                    scroll, scrolling and image stacks with mouse position.
                </p>

                <h3>Project Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    My specific goals right now are to make a more complex animation system for the image stack system with js, adding image scrolls when the user clicks the image,
                    and other general quality of life improvements.
                </p>
                <h3>Design Strategies</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm not planning on making any significant changes to the underlying design since I'm alreadt quite pleased with the font and color choices, as well as the overall effect. I'll see what I can do to improve font legibility, but that's all I'm planning for now.
                </p>
                <h3>Interaction Strategies</h3>
                <p>
                    I've decided that these will be my main areas of focus for the project:<br>
                    <li>My initial thoughts were to manipulate the images and the image stacking effect I have with even more complex animations using js.</li>
                    <li> I would also like to have specific parts of the images clickable to pull up more details on those specific parts.</li>
                </p>
                <h3>Experience Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    I want the users of my website to experience the majesty of Egypt and also learn a lot of information about those specific places that are in the pictures.
