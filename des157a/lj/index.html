                                In particular, we call UI/UX "human-centered" which implies that when the interfaces are designed, the user needs speciﬁc care and attention. I've never thought about forms personally, but I found the same interaction in games I designed – forms would be like the control configuration in games where severe quality tests are performed to check whether or not it "feels" correct. As a consequence, I can now correlate my strengths in game design to UX with the aid of <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f" target="_blank">this article</a>, and believe I have some space to make the users a backbone in the design process.

                            <p>I've examined few forms, and <a href="https://www.formstack.com/products/online-forms" target = "_blank">"Formstack Forms"</a> has certainly stood out for me. They offer a format that is effortless to use and is highly user friendly, in order to build any sort of form. It also considers the many security concerns faced today by many users through the implementation of a secure user information encryption protocol. There are even templates, which take into account the various people that don't have much time to make or fill forms. In conclusion, I will try researching more principles behind forms and what makes them tick.</p>
