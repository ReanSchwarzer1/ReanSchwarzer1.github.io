                                I chose this photo to represent my collection because of one particular reason - and it is the fact that this photo illustrates my interest in historical structures and architecture, and the great wonders of the world. Not many people can claim to see the pyramids and the sphynx, but this photo illustrates that I can. My topic will be on my journey across Egypt when I went for volunteering through AIESEC and UNESCO, and they took us all across Egypt in the weekends free of cost, to say that this was an amazing experience is an understatement.

                                As far as Rachel's picture goes, it's from her trip to Hong Kong. The picture looks to be clicked inside a shop that's selling beverages and some kind of "honey/honeycomb" dish? It's a bit hard to tell exactly what it is, since I have never seen anything like it, but it does look sumptuous! Also, some chinese / cantonese characters can be seen inside the shops, which tells us that this shop is in Hong Kong.

                                For this specific learning journal, I have chosen this <a href="https://iad-lab.ch/" target="_blank">website called IAD Lab 21</a>, which seems really "interactive" to me. On the main page, we can see four different colored ribbons which are definitely not images, so I am wondering whether three.js has been used and whether the ribbons' simulation have been designed in a 3D software like maya or blender. Overall, I like the implementation but when I generally see a side-scrolling page, I tend to gravitate towards scrolling right and left, and not top and bottom, so I do think that that can be

                                visually communicated better.<br>
                                Now when we click the ribbons, we are redirected to a page where the images align left or right in accordance with the direction in which the user scrolls. I really like that, an do feel that it feets the overall aesthetic of the website. I personally want to use something of this effect in my next studio project, where I'll be using my game screenshots and try to create a "unique" version of the steam library.

                                Out of the two articles given, I chose the <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c" target="_blank">former article</a>, by Naema Baskanderi. I found it extremely interesting to consider "pop-ups" as "modal windows," which was something totally new that I learned in design jargon. I agree with the statistics about people who do not find these pop-ups' over-usage beneficial. I also truly feel that they hinder the UI/UX experience. "Best practices" were also stated, but I honestly think they weren't particularly helpful to improve the experience that had already been impaired.

                                A case was also presented regarding the use of modal windows in mobile webpages. They hinder the overall experience even more exponentially in mobiles, and the ways to rectify the problems are even less for mobile platforms, therefore it's standard procedure to avoid them entirely when designing interactive webpages specifically for mobiles.

                                In particular, we call UI/UX "human-centered" which implies that when the interfaces are designed, the user needs speciﬁc care and attention. I've never thought about forms personally, but I found the same interaction in games I designed – forms would be like the control configuration in games where severe quality tests are performed to check whether or not it "feels" correct. As a consequence, I can now correlate my strengths in game design to UX with the aid of <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f" target="_blank">this article</a>, and believe I have some space to make the users a backbone in the design process.

                                I've examined few forms, and <a href="https://www.formstack.com/products/online-forms" target = "_blank">"Formstack Forms"</a> has certainly stood out for me. They offer a format that is effortless to use and is highly user friendly, in order to build any sort of form. It also considers the many security concerns faced today by many users through the implementation of a secure user information encryption protocol. There are even templates, which take into account the various people that don't have much time to make or fill forms. In conclusion, I will try researching more principles behind forms and what makes them tick.
