                                Anything a user has to interact with needs special
                                consideration and care when being designed. This is
                                especially true for forms, where a user can provide
                                valuable input. Personally, form design is something
                                I've always struggled with. I'm never quite sure of how
                                to make the best form, even though they're incredibly
                                vital to most projects I work on. Because of this, I
                                found the <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">article provided</a>
                                to be very helpful.

                        <div class="col2">
                            <p> 
                                It gives actionable and objective
                                guidelines to follow that makes it really easy to create
                                a well-designed form. One thing I found interesting was
                                the comments on the article. In particular, a user
                                points out that NN group's article on
                                <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/required-fields/">"Marking Required Fields in Forms"</a>
                                contradicts point 5 in the UX Collective's article. I
                                think that explicitly stating which form fields are
                                required is a good thing, but I'll definitely experiment
                                around with it to find the option that works best for
                                me.
